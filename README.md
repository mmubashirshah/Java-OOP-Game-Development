# Text-Based Adventure Game (Java, OOP)

## 📌 Project Overview
A **text-based rogue-like adventure game** implemented in **Java**, showcasing strong application of **object-oriented design principles** and software engineering practices.  
This project demonstrates designing, extending, and maintaining a complex system using **clean code, UML, and iterative development**.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Player character system** with health and stamina management  
- **NPC creatures** (e.g., Spirit Goats, Omen Sheep) with unique behaviours and lifespans  
- **Planting system** where crops (Inheritree & Bloodrose) alter the game environment and impact gameplay  
- **Special item mechanics** (Talisman) that interact with creatures and terrain  
- Continuous display of player attributes (HP & stamina) with real-time updates  

## 🧩 Design & Architecture
- Developed **UML class diagrams** for each feature requirement  
- Wrote a **design rationale** explaining design choices, trade-offs, and adherence to **SOLID principles**  
- Ensured maintainability and extensibility for future game features  

## 💻 Technical Highlights
- Language: **Java**
- Principles: **Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism**
- Tools: **UML (class diagrams), Git/GitHub, IDEs**
- Standards: **Google Java Style Guide**, Javadoc for public/protected methods  

## 🚀 Outcome
The project resulted in a maintainable and extensible **object-oriented system**, demonstrating expertise in:  
✅ Object-Oriented Design (OOP)  
✅ Java Programming  
✅ UML Modelling & Software Architecture  
✅ Refactoring & Debugging  
✅ Git Version Control & Documentation
