# Assignment 3:

# REQ3: Farmer's Descent into the Hollow Roots
Deep below the world of the Farmer lies a web of ancient tunnels called the ***Hollow Roots***. Farmers can now descend into these mysterious underground caverns to mine for hidden relics and magical resources.

Scattered across the world are ***glowing sinkholes*** the entrance points to the Hollow Roots.

The Farmer can purchase ***a pickaxe*** from merchants allowing them the ability to mine ores.

Once inside, the Farmer will see shimmering (â¤±) glyphs embedded in the stone. These symbols represent mineable ***Ores***. Upon mining, the ore will reveal one of three treasures:
* *Ore Pieces* - Can be sold for Runes.
* *Charm Pieces* - Magical items that enhance abilities (explained further in REQ4). 
* *Fossils* - Upon mined these will turn into NPCs (e.g., Spirit Goat, Omen Sheep).

Mining consumes 10 stamina. Some ores are more durable and take longer to break, requiring multiple actions.

**Strategy of Implementation:**
   * *Higher Level Class:* MineAction - used for mining ores 
   * *Interface/Abstract Classes:* Ores & Mineable - defines the things which can be mined and possible items 
   * *Lower Level Classes:* Fossils, Charms and Runes

# REQ4: Crafting at the Arcane Benches
The art of crafting has returned. Hidden in key locations around the world lie ancient Arcane Benches, remnants of forgotten knowledge that allow the Farmer to forge powerful items from the materials uncovered in the Hollow Roots.

In gameplay, there is only ***one Arcane Bench***, but for narrative purposes, they are scattered across the realm in sacred spots of arcane energy.

The Farmer can now perform ***CraftActions*** when standing adjacent to an Arcane Bench, provided they hold the required materials. No crafting interface is required - crafting is enabled purely through possession of the right components.

Using relics mined from the Hollow Roots, the Farmer may craft potent weapons and magical tools.
